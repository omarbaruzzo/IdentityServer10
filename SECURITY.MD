# Reporting Security Issues

If you discover a security issue in **IdentityServer10**, please report it directly to the maintainer of this repository.

- Preferred: open a **private security advisory** / security issue on GitHub in the official IdentityServer10 repository.
- Alternatively: use the contact channel linked from the project page (GitHub profile and/or associated website).

Please **do not** open a public issue containing exploit details before a fix is available.

This file replaces the old instructions that pointed to `contact@identityserver8.io`, which referred to the original IdentityServer8 project.

Thanks!
