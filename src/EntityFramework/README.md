# IdentityServer10.EntityFramework

`IdentityServer10.EntityFramework` provides the Entity Framework–based persistence layer for IdentityServer10 configuration data.

Historically this package was named `IdentityServer8.EntityFramework` and targeted the IdentityServer8 line; it has since been migrated and aligned with **IdentityServer10** on .NET 10.
