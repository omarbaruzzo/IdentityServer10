## Filing issues
The best way to get your bug fixed is to be as detailed as you can about the problem.
Providing a minimal project or a minimal repro with steps to reproduce the problem is ideal.
Here are questions you can answer before you file a bug to make sure you're not missing any important information:

1. Did you read the project documentation in this repository (`README.md`, `MIGRATION_NET10.md`, `docs/`), and (optionally) the historical IdentityServer8 docs at <https://identityserver8.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>?
2. Did you include the snippet of broken code in the issue?
3. What are the *EXACT* steps to reproduce this problem?
4. Did you enable logging and capture the relevant logs?

GitHub supports [markdown](http://github.github.com/github-flavored-markdown/), so when filing bugs make sure you check the formatting before clicking submit.

## Contributing code and content
Please make sure to include tests that cover the changes/additions you make to the code base.

Make sure you can build the code. Familiarize yourself with the project workflow and our coding conventions. If you don't know what a pull request is read this article: <https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests>.

Before submitting a feature or substantial code contribution please discuss it via an issue first to ensure it follows the project roadmap. Here's a list of blog posts that are worth reading before doing a pull request:
